<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify">As a result of years of research, we know that too much animal fat is bad for our health. For example, Americans eat a lot of meat and only a small amount of grains, fruit and vegetables. Because of their diet, they have high rate of cancer and heart disease. In Japan, in contrast, people eat large amount of grains and very little meat. The Japanese also have very low rates of cancer and heart disease. In fact, the Japanese live longer than anyone else in the world. Unfortunately, when japanese people move to the United States, the rates of heart disease and cancer increase as their diet changes. Moreover, as hamburgers, ice cream, and other high fat foods become popular in Japan, the rates of heart disease and cancer are increasing there as well. People are also eating more meat and diary products in other countries such as Cuba, Mauritius and Hungary. Not surprisingly, the disease rates in these countries are increasing along with the change in diet. Consequently, doctors everywhere advise people to eat more grains and vegetables and to eat less meat and fewer diary products.</p>
